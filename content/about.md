Hey there, I'm Mike. Thanks for stopping by...

I am 25+ year veteran of IT infrastructure and operations, I often have to figure out how to solve problems in interesting ways. Over the past 10 years, automation has changed the way I work. Honestly, it has completely transformed my professional life and opened doors in Information Technology that I never thought possible. Automation and scripting changed everything for me, and I never went back. Since then, I have spent 1000s of hours trying to learn how to do things with code. It's been an amazing, but sometimes frustrating journey! Over time, I understood the importance of sharing my knowledge with others.

I am currently employed by Align Technology and oversee a global team focused on developing automation tools for on-prem and cloud technologies like AzureAD, Exchange, Server Management, and core Active Directory technologies. Every day, I am immersed in automation. I get to see what works and what doesn't.

This website allows me to share the tips and tricks I've learned over the years that have been instrumental in my automation success. My writing focuses on PowerShell, Active Directory, Azure AD, automation fundamentals, and other topics that sysadmins encounter in their daily routines. My articles provide solutions for common issues and offer tips for efficient coding. I talk about the problems I encounter at work and share solutions to support others.

Besides blogging, I am very active in the PowerShell community and I leverage those contacts to bring great content to you every month at this website and through the user group I lead. The Research Triangle PowerShell user group is the largest PowerShell group in the United States with over 3000 members and we meet twice a month to share ideas with community members. I'm also the community director for the DevOps Collective and their website, PowerShell.org.

I made this website to help others learn PowerShell and automation. Besides this website, I write often for technical websites and online publications. Here's a list of places and things I've contributed to that you might like.
