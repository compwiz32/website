Hey there, I'm Mike. Thanks for stopping by...

I have been working in IT for over 25 years, and I thoroughly enjoy finding creative solutions to challenges. Automation has revolutionized the way I work in the past decade. Since embracing automation and scripting, I have dedicated 1000s hours to learning how to accomplish tasks through coding, and it has been an incredible but occasionally frustrating journey. As time went on, I realized the importance of sharing my knowledge with others.

This website serves as a platform for me to share the tips and tricks I have learned over the years that have played a crucial role in my success with automation. My writing primarily revolves around PowerShell, Active Directory, Azure AD, automation fundamentals, and other topics that system administrators encounter in their daily routines. Through my articles, I provide solutions to common issues and offer insights into efficient coding. I discuss the problems I face at work and share solutions to assist others.

Currently, I am employed at Align Technology, where I oversee a global team focused on developing automation tools for on-prem and cloud technologies such as AzureAD, Exchange, Server Management, and core Active Directory technologies. Automation is a part of my daily life, and I am constantly exposed to what works and what doesn't.

Besides blogging, I am an active member of the PowerShell community. I am the co-lead of the Research Triangle PowerShell user group. We are the largest PowerShell group in the United States, with over 3000 members. We meet twice a month to exchange ideas with fellow community members. I also serve as the community director for the DevOps Collective and their website, PowerShell.org.

Apart from this website, I frequently contribute to technical websites and online publications. Here is a list of places and projects where I have made contributions you might find interesting.
