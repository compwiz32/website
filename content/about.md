Hey there! I'm Mike Kanakos. Thanks for stopping by.

I've spent 25 years figuring out enterprise identity and access management—Active Directory, Azure/Entra ID, PKI, SSO, MFA, compliance automation. I lead a team building these systems at scale, and before that, I built automation platforms, passwordless authentication, and SOC2/SOX workflows. But I spent years before that in the trenches—managing Windows servers, configuring applications, handling client issues, living the sysadmin life. Made plenty of mistakes along the way.

This site is where I write down what actually works. You'll find guides on PowerShell, identity management, certificate services, and infrastructure automation—practical stuff aimed at people who already know the basics and just need to see how someone else solved the problem.

I'm a 5x Microsoft MVP for PowerShell and Azure. I run the Research Triangle PowerShell User Group because I like talking through solutions with other people dealing with the same challenges. We've built a community of thousands who get excited about PowerShell and making their work easier. If that's you, come join us. I also help organize the PowerShell Summit through the DevOps Collective and PowerShell.org.

I've written for [Petri](https://petri.com/author/mike-kanakos/), [4sysops](https://4sysops.com/members/mkanakos/), [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Mike-Kanakos), and [Progress/Ipswitch](https://www.ipswitch.com/blog/author/mike-kanakos), and contributed to a few PowerShell community books ([PowerShell Conference Book volume 1](https://leanpub.com/powershell-conference-book?ref=commandline.ninja) & [2](https://leanpub.com/psconfbook2?ref=commandline.ninja), and [#PS7Now: A Blogger's Guide to Getting Started with PowerShell 7](https://leanpub.com/ps7now?ref=commandline.ninja) ).

Look around, try some code, let me know if something helps—or doesn't work.
