- Do you have questions?
- Looking for more information on a topic?
- Want to learn more about an upcoming PowerShell event?

Send me a message! I will do my best to respond as quickly as possible.

Please be aware that I receive an overwhelming amount of requests for code help with individuals' scripts. Although I appreciate your interest in my support, my resources are limited and I usually cannot offer individual code help. Just to be clear, I won't write code for you or fix any of your scripts.

If you need help with coding, I recommend checking out the PowerShell-Help forum. The community is full of talented folks who can help with your coding questions. You can access the forum via [Discord](https://aka.ms/psdiscord) or [Slack](https://aka.ms/psslack).

The forum is invite only, but all you need to do is follow one of the links I posted above and you will be immediately invited into the forum. Once you're in, you can find the #powershell-help channel on the left-hand side. It's the first one listed.
