Have questions about something I wrote? Want to know about an upcoming PowerShell event? Send me a message and I'll do my best to respond.

About code help: I get a lot of requests for help debugging scripts or writing custom code. I wish I could help everyone individually, but between work, family, and community stuff, I just don't have the bandwidth. If you need coding help, check out the PowerShell-Help forum. It's a solid community where people actually work through problems together. You can join via [Discord](https://aka.ms/psdiscord) or [Slack](https://aka.ms/psslack) — the links get you in immediately. Look for the _powershell-help_ channel.

The reality is the _powershell-help_ forum will get better, faster help than waiting on me. Most people get answers to their questions in under 15 minutes.
