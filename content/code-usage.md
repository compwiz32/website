title: Steal My Code!

I stumbled across a great post on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/05/20/good-coders-borrow-great-coders-steal/) talking about taking code from others and using it for your own. I liked it so much, that I used the core of the article to explain how I feel about others using my code.

Many people attribute the quote to the famous artist Pablo Picasso:

> "Good artists borrow, great artists steal."

Taking something without permission is just plain wrong, especially when you pretend it's yours. That's plagiarism. But the quote I mentioned earlier uses "steal" to mean something different. When you borrow something, it's still someone else's. If you want to own an idea, you need to make it yours. You need to learn from that idea and then explain in your own way.

> Taking credit for someone else's idea is borrowing; understanding an idea and weaving it into your own work, that's what he meant by theft.

I encourage you to use the code I post on this website for your own personal use. However, you need to understand a few important things before you do so.

### The code I share is not exactly what I use in production, but it's close**

My home lab serves as the testing ground where I write and verify the code for the concepts I discuss in my articles. What works for me in my small environment may not be suitable for production deployment in your organization. I'll make every attempt to mention in my articles whether the code I've written is appropriate for corporate settings, but it's crucial to test it before running.

### You can use my code, but you still need to give me the credit

Let me be real with you... I wanna do my bit and assist others. I just want to be acknowledged for helping people. Neglecting to acknowledge your sources undermines the core principles of a thriving community. You're not contributing to what came before you. Your actions are harming the open source community and compromising the knowledge sharing process. Just do the right thing and give credit if you borrow from my site.
