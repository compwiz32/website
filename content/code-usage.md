title: Steal My Code!

I stumbled across a great post on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/05/20/good-coders-borrow-great-coders-steal/) talking about taking code from others and using it for your own. I liked it so much, that I decided to use the core of the article to explain how I feel about others using my code.

The famous artist Pablo Picasso is quoted as saying:

> "Good artists borrow, great artists steal."

Stealing sounds wrong, and in fact, claiming someone else's work as your own is plagiarism. But the quote above is using the word "steal" to say something a little different.. A borrowed object still belongs to someone else; you copy a style and it still belongs to someone else. To steal, however, is to make that idea your own. Taking credit for someone else's idea is borrowing; understanding an idea and weaving it into your own work, that's what he meant by theft.

I encourage you to use the code I post on this website for your own personal use. However, you need to understand a few important things before you do so.

### The code I share is not exactly what I use in production, but it's close**

Often, I write my code using my home lab as the test bed to prove or verify the concepts I share in my articles. Just because it works for me in my small environment, doesn't mean it's ready for production deployment in your org! I will make every effort to call out in my articles if I think the code I have written is good for using in coporate settings, but you still need to to test my code, BEFORE your run it.

### You can use my code, but you still need to give me the credit

Please, please, please... Think twice before blindly copying code and running it in your org! I am not responsible if you blow up things in your network because you copied my code! Now, with all that said... Here's the rules governing the fair use of my code and the articles written on this sight.
