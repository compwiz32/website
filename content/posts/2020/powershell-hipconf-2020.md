I recently was a guest on the [Hybrid Identity Podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/hybrid-identity-protection-podcast) to discuss getting started with automation and how it fits in with Identity Management.  This is a new podcast presented by [Semperis](https://www.semperis.com/) and hosted by 15 time MVP [Sean Deuby](https://www.semperis.com/company/). The podcast is off to a fantastic start with wide range of experts in the field of Identity Management. It's a great listen because of the topics but also because the episodes are only 15-20 minutes in length. Our discussion was targeted at IT pros who have not yet made the jump to the cmd line, scripting and automation. We finished up with some tips on how anyone can started to get comfortable at the cmd line with some minimal effort. I've included the YouTube link below but you can also listen on all the major [podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/hybrid-identity-protection-podcast) platforms as well.
