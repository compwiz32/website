I recently did a demo for the [Southern California PowerShell Users group](https://www.meetup.com/SoCal-PowerShell-User-Group/) on how to get started with the PowerShell [SecretManagement](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement/) module from Microsoft. This module has become part of my every day toolkit and solved the challenges I was facing trying to manage password for my scripts. The module and the concepts of secrets management are very easy to understand and master.

The video covers three main areas:

- how to install and configure the SecretsManagement and SecretStore modules
- how to create, manage and use secrets
- how the SecretManagement module can be used with other password managers such as KeePass and others.

When you finish watching this video, you should have enough knowledge to set this up and use it with your scripts and every day tasks! In addition to the video, you can also reference the [article](https://4sysops.com/archives/secretsmanagement-module-for-powershell-save-passwords-in-powershell/) I wrote that explains the installation, configuration and daily management of Secrets in detail. The article mirrors this video closely and is a great reference if you would like to have something to refer back to from time to time. Keep an eye out for some follow up articles that I will be writing to show how the different vault modules written by the community work with the Secret Management module. Thanks for reading, I'd love to know what you think of this content. Leave me a message in the comment section at the bottom of the page and I will follow up with you.
