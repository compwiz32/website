Last week I was fortunate to have attended the PowerShell Summit in Bellevue, Washington on behalf of my employer. The summit, which is organized and run by the PowerShell.org website, was a combination of keynote speeches by industry leaders followed by three days of deep-dive presentations on all things PowerShell.

Being that this was my first time attending, I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. Read about my experience over at the [4sysops website](https://4sysops.com/archives/powershell-summit-2018-recap/) .
