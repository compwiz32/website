Last week I was fortunate to have attended the PowerShell Summit in Bellevue, Washington on behalf of my employer. The summit, which is organized and run by the PowerShell.org website, was a combination of keynote speeches by industry leaders followed by three days of deep-dive presentations on all things PowerShell.

Being that this was my first time attending, I honestly wasn't sure what to expect.

   You might wonder why some articles like this one only have a sneak peek here. I write for a few websites, and they own the articles, so I can't post the full article here. But I can give you a summary of the article so you can check it out.
