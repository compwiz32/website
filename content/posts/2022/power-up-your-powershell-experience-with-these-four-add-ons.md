The creators of PowerShell have introduced new tools and functionality to enhance your experience with it. [Over at the TechTarget website](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/tip/Use-these-PowerShell-add-ons-to-supercharge-your-experience?ref=commandline.ninja), I discuss four additions that can enhance your everyday use of PowerShell.

The article talks about recent improvements in PowerShell, focusing on tools and features that make it easier for users to work with. It discusses PowerShell's extensibility, introduction of ANSI colors and $PSStyle variable, customization of command-line editing with PSReadLine module, and integration of Azure's AI capabilities through the Az Predictor module. It examines techniques for managing PowerShell output data, using modules like Out-GridView and ConsoleGuiTools to enhance data visualization and interaction in the PowerShell console environment.
