Although the Azure portal is sufficient for basic user and group management in Azure Active Directory, PowerShell is the best option for making extensive modifications. However, there are conditions to think about before you can enjoy the advantages of automation.

While the Azure portal provides a graphical interface for user and group management in Azure AD, it may not be the most efficient approach to tasks involving hundreds or thousands of users. PowerShell is perfect for automating bulk operations in Azure AD, like adding or removing users from a group. It takes effort to figure out the optimal approach as different PowerShell versions cause different modules. Discover the step-by-step process of executing bulk operations with the AzureAD and Azure Az modules in this tutorial.
