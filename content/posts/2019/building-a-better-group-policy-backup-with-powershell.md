I have always been a bit frustrated with the built-in group policy cmdlets included from Microsoft. Don't get me wrong, they work absolutely fine, but sometimes they don't work in a way that makes them easy to use. To highlight this fact, I recently wrote an article over at [4sysops](https://4sysops.com/archives/group-policy-backup-with-a-powershell/) describing my experiences with the `Backup-GPO` cmdlet and the output of the cmdlet. 

Instead of dealing with an output I didn't like, I built a better backup tool using the existing cmdlets that gives me the output in a much easier format to understand than what is possible with the cmdlets on their own. 

I invite you to follow the link below and read my article on Building a better Group Policy backup tool with PowerShell. You can find the article [here](https://4sysops.com/archives/group-policy-backup-with-a-powershell/) . 

Please let me know what you think in the comments below or at the 4sysops website. I hope you find this tool a useful addition to your sysadmin toolkit! Your feedback and comments are always welcome!
