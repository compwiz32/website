Did you know you could deploy printers through Group Policy?

Printer management is one of those tasks that I think NO ONE looks forward to. I'd like to show you how you can make it a bit easier. I have written a deep dive article over at [4sysops](https://4sysops.com/archives/deploying-printers-using-group-policy/) that walks you through exactly how to configure printer deployment via GPO. 

I have used this at every employer I have worked at and it really makes it easy to get printers onto employee PC's without alot of effort. I prefer to use AD groups to manage who should get a printer, but that's not the only method you can use. 

Head on over to [4sysops](https://4sysops.com/archives/deploying-printers-using-group-policy/) and let me know what you think either through the comment system on their website or down below on my site. I appreciate the feedback and do read every comment and try to respond to every one.

Thanks again for reading! Also, don't forget that if you have a topic you wished I cover, let me know and I'll try to do a write-up on it.
