Earlier this week, I was viewing tweets on Twitter and stumbled across this tweet in my twitter feed:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Made it to #42 on the list, which is the best number in the universe if you ask me! <a href="https://t.co/qahRYZ5kpy">https://t.co/qahRYZ5kpy</a></p>&mdash; Brandon Olin (@devblackops) <a href="https://twitter.com/devblackops/status/1037007089841856512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I was genuinely curious to see the others blogger's on the list since I have been able to get to know many of them over the last year of blogging. So I click the link: [https://www.sqlshack.com/top-50-powershell-bloggers-of-2018/](https://www.sqlshack.com/top-50-powershell-bloggers-of-2018/) ...and browse down the list and, much to my surprise.... **I am on the list at #47!**

Wow! I was utterly shocked  to make a list of top PowerShell bloggers and so happy that people think my content is interesting! First, I need to say thank you to https://www.sqlshack.com for selecting me to be on the list. Next, I would like to say, thank you to my readers who continually come back to my site.

I'll be ramping up the content on this site as I now am starting to see trends as to what people are looking to read. Ultimately, I write articles to share information with others and help people learn new concepts.  As I usually say in all my articles, let me know what YOU like to read by leaving a comment below and I would be glad to try and write something specifically about your interests.

THANK YOU!
