Today I will show you how to build a PowerShell script that looks up and displays customized information about Active Directory users. Your helpdesk staff can use the script to retrieve information from Active Directory without having to know PowerShell. You can tailor the script specifically to your needs.

I've written a detailed post walking you through how to build this tool step by step over at the [4sysops](https://4sysops.com/archives/powershell-script-to-display-information-about-active-directory-users/) website .
