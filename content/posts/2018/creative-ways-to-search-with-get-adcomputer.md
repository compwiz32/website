If you work with Active Directory at all then `Get-ADComputer` is a PowerShell cmdlet that you will use at some point, and if you're like me, you will use it multiple times per day. 

`Get-ADComputer` is basically a search cmdlet. It might seem easier to use the GUI for search rather than the command line, but that's not entirely true. Yes, search in **Active Directory Users and Computers** or **Active Directory Administrative Center** GUI tools is fast, but trying to perform complex criteria searches is difficult at best and usually not doable at all. Once you get used to the simple cmdlet syntax, you quickly realize how fast you can pull complex sets of information using the cmdlet instead of the GUI. 

I have published an article over on [4sysops](https://4sysops.com/archives/search-active-directory-with-the-powershell-cmdlet-get%E2%80%91adcomputer/) that walks you through how to do some creative searches of Active Directory using `Get-ADComputer`. Click the link above get transported over to the article!
