Last week I gave a presentation on configuring PowerShell remoting security and logging for my user group. This talk focused on how to properly setup remoting security and logging options. I talk briefly about how remoting works with some simple examples of what a real-world remoting connection looks like.

Today I am sharing with you the [link](https://youtu.be/rvg8FNFkpco) to the recorded video.  So why do you need to know this?

I believe that remoting in PowerShell unfairly gets a bad rap in the security world and the truth is that when done right; PowerShell remoting is equal to SSH. The problem is that Microsoft and Windows get a bad rap because most people assume Windows is not secure.

I invite you to watch the video and take notes. If you have questions, please reach out to me via the comments here or via the contact information posted in the video. Also, you can more links on this website that discuss remoting in detail.

You can refer to these articles I have written for more information:

* [How to secure PowerShell Remoting in a Windows Domain](https://commandline.ninja/posts/securing-powershell/)
* [WMI vs CIM: What's the Difference?](https://commandline.ninja/posts/wmi-vs-cim-whats-the-difference/)

I have also written about this topic in the PowerShell conference Book volume 2 which will be released in the Fall of 2019.
