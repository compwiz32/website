Hey PowerShell family...

This is just a short blog post to share that I have expanded my original blog post on Get-ADUser Syntax and Examples.

The refreshed blog post is just under 3000 words and contains 15 different Get-ADUser examples that may be useful in your day-to-day admin tasks. This post has been one of my most successful posts since the website was setup. My objective was to enhance it. Also, sometime this week, I will start recording video content for the website and this post will serve as the basis for my first video.

You can find the post here:

Thanks for reading!
